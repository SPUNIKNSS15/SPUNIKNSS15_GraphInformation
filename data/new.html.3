<li>2013-09-16 Added adjoints as the first directed graph class.</li>
<li>2013-03-13 Added option to show only inclusion minimal/maximal boundary classes in the application.</li>
<li>2013-03-01 Smallgraphs available in graph6 format.</li>
<li>2012-09-08 The ISGCI database is included in Sage.</li>
<li>2012-01-14 'Find relation' in the Java application now gives a witness for proper inclusions.</li>
<li>2011-11-12 'Find relation' in the Java application now can detect disjoint and incomparable classes.</li>

<li>2011-04-11 Drawing two classes but not the classes between them, now draws the corresponding arrow.</li>
<li>2011-03-01 New website <a href="http://www.graphclasses.org">www.graphclasses.org</a> went online.</li>
<li>2011-01-21 Added Weighted clique, Treewidth, Colourability, 3-Colourability and Vertex cover problems. Improved deduction of complexity. Nicer formatting of problems, with a summary page per problem.</li>
<li>2010-12-20 Added Clique problem.</li>

<li>2010-05-28 Distinguish between proper and unproper subclasses.</li>
<li>2010-03-05 Application converted to Java 1.6. Web pages given a new layout.</li>

<li>2005-07-19 Super/subclass information and summarized complexity information on webpage of each graphclass </li>
<li>2005-02-27 Sorting order on webpages matches order in applet.</li>
<li>2005-02-01 Added complement classes to the webpage of every graphclass.</li>
<li>2004-08-30 Abbreviate long names in drawing and windows, changed "change name" popup menu item.</li>

<li>2003-09-09 Printing works. You need at least Java 1.3 to make use of this feature.</li>
<li>2003-05-21 Classnames have changed. Lists of forbidden subgraphs are alphabetized and normalized (e.g. always fork instead of chair or co-kite), unions and intersections of graphclasses have their constituent graphclasses in alphabetical order.</li>
